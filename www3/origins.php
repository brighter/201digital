          <p>Now and again, when time was with us, and the family commitments diary was resting its ugly head, we'd call together the old crew. A group of like minded individuals who had all met at University. It was there in the old potting shed (our den), a few seeds of inspiration, vision and passion were sown. As a group we had collectively been working in Internet based companies and the web for nearly 20 years. We watched it grow, we helped the companies we work for grow, and during that time we became experts in our individual fields. Between us we could combine our expertise in technical, creative and marketing know how to create a full service digital marketing agency.</p>
          <p>We had done so much between us for the companies we worked for, we were specialists now and it was time we passed our expertise on to others. So what better a response we thought, than in the language of the internet, and we gave our idea a HTTP 201 response status:</p>
          <div class='slightbox'>
 <h2 class='subtitle'>HTTP Response Code: 201</h2><p class='emphasised'>"The request has been fulfilled and a new resource has been created"</p><p>(<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes' alt="link to http:201 response code definition on wikipedia">see wikipedia</a>)</p>
 </div>
 <h2 class='subtitle'>And so 201 Digital was born.<h2>
