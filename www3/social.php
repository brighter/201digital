          <p>That's how it felt to when I decided to setup 201Digital. As always it started with an idea, what if I could combine my 20 years experience programming for the Internet, an understanding and experience of the driving forces behind Internet Marketing and the creative skills of a good design team? By combining these skills and formulating a "framework for success" - a cohesive, multi-platform approach to on-line marketing I was sure we could deliver positives results to businesses who wanted to make a success of their on-line ventures.</p>
          <p>Being successul on-line requires that you explore and address the many channels that are available right now. This can be a daunting task which is why we are here to help.</p>
